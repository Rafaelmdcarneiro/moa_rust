 
Moa Frontend using Pixels
=========================

This is a frontend for the moa emulator that uses the [pixels]() crate as the rendering library,
and which can be compiled to wasm and run in a web browser.

To start the server with Sega Genesis emulation, run:
```sh
just serve moa-genesis
```
